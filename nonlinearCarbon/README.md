# This directory contains code for non-linear carbon

- `temp-carbon-oscillation-odes-co2added-fixed-clean-vegtemp-biopumptemp-APR2022.py` is the python code provided by Erik,
- `HJB.ipynb` is the jupyter notebook attempting to solve the 3D nonlinear Carbon dynamic HJB.
- `Impulse response.py` does the pulse experiment with the nonlinear carbon model.
- `Plots.ipynb` plots impulse reponse with two sets of (heat capacity, characteristic time).
- [`T_C_E_10.0_1886.0.pdf`](./T_C_E_10.0_1886.0.pdf) and [`T_C_E_35_6603.pdf`](./T_C_E_35_6603.pdf) are plots of temperature anomaly, carbon concentration, and optimal emission with two sets of (cearth, tauc):
	(10, 1886) and (35, 6603)
